# Malicious-File-Identification

## Objective
This project focused on developing foundational skills in analyzing potentially malicious files and gathering actionable intelligence. The primary objective was to perform basic triage on commonly weaponized file types, helping to identify threats efficiently. Open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques were employed to quickly collect relevant information that could support further investigation. Additionally, the project introduced practical methods for dissecting malicious files, offering hands-on experience in understanding how such threats operate and how to approach their analysis.

### Skills Learned
- Acquired in-depth knowledge of SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) operations, including log collection, normalization, and correlation techniques.

- Gained hands-on experience in analyzing various types of logs (firewall, IDS/IPS, system, application) to detect security incidents.

- Developed the ability to identify and interpret attack patterns, including common indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

- Strengthened understanding of key network protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, etc.) and their exploitation in cyberattacks.

- Improved analytical thinking and incident triage capabilities through simulated real-world scenarios and investigations.

### Tools Used

- SIEM platforms such as Splunk and Elastic Stack (ELK) for log management, correlation, and incident detection.

- Wireshark for packet capture and in-depth network traffic analysis.

- Kibana for data visualization and dashboard creation to monitor security events.

- Suricata and Snort for intrusion detection and analyzing attack signatures.

- Linux command-line tools (e.g., tcpdump, netstat, grep, awk) for log parsing and system diagnostics.

- Virtualized lab environments using tools like VirtualBox and VMware for simulating cyberattacks and defensive responses.
